## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 

### What I learned

This project was the easiest so far, its very simple so i did not learn a lot from doing it, but it was a good practice. One thing i should mention that i started to use Josh Comeau's custom reset, here is a very nice explanation that which part does what: [Josh Comeau's blog]((https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)) My plan is to use it in every project. It was good to practice variables too without overwhelming myself.

### Continued development

I think my approach is pretty close to the design and i dont think the solution could be improved by a lot. Maybe sometime i will add some animations to it, but for now i am satisfied with it.
